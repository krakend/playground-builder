## MCP Server - AI Gateway Integration

This endpoint implements a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**, enabling AI and Large Language Model (LLM) integration with KrakenD.

### About MCP

The Model Context Protocol is a standard for exposing tools and data sources to AI assistants. This endpoint acts as a gateway that AI models can call to access structured data and execute backend operations.

### Available Tools

The MCP server exposes the following tool:

**`get_country_info`** - Retrieves comprehensive country data by aggregating multiple public APIs:
- REST Countries API (geography, population, borders, flags)
- GraphQL Countries API (currency, languages, native names)

### Usage

This is a POST endpoint that accepts MCP protocol requests. AI assistants and LLMs can call this endpoint to access country information through a standardized protocol.

Example country code: Use two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (e.g., `ES` for Spain, `FR` for France, `US` for United States)

### Technical Details

- **Method**: POST only
- **Timeout**: 15 seconds
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Backend**: Aggregates REST and GraphQL APIs
- **License**: Enterprise Edition only

See the [AI Gateway documentation](https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/ai-gateway/) for more information about MCP integration.

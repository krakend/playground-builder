## Endpoint
```http
/shop
```

## Stateless rate limiting
This use case demonstrates two different types of stateless rate limiting while doing API composition:

- The `qos/ratelimit/proxy` limits the interaction between the gateway and the backend at 1 request per second
- The  `qos/ratelimit/router` limits the interaction between the user and the gateway at 2 requests per second

As you can see, the configuration has two backends, and one has no limitation `qos/ratelimit/proxy`.


Now, if you call this endpoint more than 1-2 times per second, you will start to see the limitations.

### Rate limit exceeded
If you call the `/shop` endpoint more than 2 times within one second you will get an error status code and no response:

```
curl -i http://localhost:8080/shop
```

### Partially rate-limited
If you call the endpoint quickly enough not to pass the 2 requests per second but surpass 1 request per second, then you will have a partial response containing the backend that is not a rate limit at the proxy level. So the response contains `campaigns` but it does not have `products`.

To see all types of rate limiting, see the [Throttling documentation](https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/throttling/)

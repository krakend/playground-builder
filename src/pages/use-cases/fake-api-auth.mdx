import MdxLayout from '@/components/MdxLayout';

## Endpoint
```
/fake-api-auth/*
```

## Wildcard routes with Basic Auth
This is the same [`fake-api` wildcard functionality](/use-cases/fake-api) that calls our open fake backend, but before trying to retrieve its contents it will demand the user to be authenticated.

Notice that the only data the endpoint needs to require authentication is one-line:
```
"auth/basic": {}
```

The credentials and rest of the configuration is taken from the root of the `krakend.json` configuration. See the [Basic Authentication documentation](https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/authentication/basic-authentication/)


For the test, you can call any file under the `data` folder of the project and use `admin` as user and `admin` as password:

```
curl -iG 'http://admin:admin@localhost:8080/fake-api-auth/articles.json'
```

And for the unauthorized version:
```
curl -iG 'http://localhost:8080/fake-api-auth/articles.json'
```

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>
}

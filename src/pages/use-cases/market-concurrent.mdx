## Endpoint
```
/market/concurrent
```

This endpoint calls the same external API from CoinGecko that returns the cryptocurrency information you used in the [non-current option](/demo/use-cases/market-concurrent).

The difference is its **lower load time and error rate**. You will need to open the tracing integration to compare timings.

## Concurrent calls
Notice that the endpoint has a `concurrent_calls` set to `3`. When you call the endpoint, KrakenD fires **three simultaneous connections** to the CoinGecko API and returns the **first fastest successful response**, canceling immediately the remaining calls to complete. See the [Concurrent Calls Documentation](https://www.krakend.io/docs/endpoints/concurrent-requests/)

Call it at least once to compare in the tracing dashboard the difference in load times vs the [non-concurrent option](/demo/use-cases/market-simple)

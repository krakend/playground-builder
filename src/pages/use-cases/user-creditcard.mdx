## Endpoint
```
/user/creditcard
```

## Content manipulation with regular expressions
This endpoint calls a backend that returns user information, from which we want to retrieve only the `credit_card` field. Instead of returning the credit card number, the plugin replaces the numbers to show only the last 4 digits.

The regexp used in this example is `"find": "^.*(\\d{4})"` and we replace the captured group with `XXXX-${1}`, so a string like `1234-56789-1234-5678` becomes `XXXX-5678`.
This is a ridiculous, non-real-life example to illustrate the replacement.

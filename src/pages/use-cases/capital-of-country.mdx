## Endpoint
```http
/starwars_films/{movie_id}
```

## SOAP to REST
This use case demonstrates exposing a SOAP backend as a regular REST API. API users don't realize they are consuming a SOAP service.

There are two things to have in mind in this example

## Request transformation
When the user sends a request like `GET /capital-of/FR`, the gateway needs to convert this request into an XML body using a POST method. The configuration `backend/soap` takes care of this by specifying a template that writes the XML body. It is located under `/extended/templates/soap_request_capital_city.tmpl.xml` and looks like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <CapitalCity xmlns="http://www.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo">
      <sCountryISOCode>{{ .req_params.Country }}</sCountryISOCode>
    </CapitalCity>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

The gateway replaces the variable `{{ .req_params.Country }}` with the endpoint parameter, like `FR` for France.

## Response transformation
As no `output_encoding` exists, the gateway will default to its JSON response, which is transformed on the fly. In addition, the `target` attribute selects the `CapitalCityResponse` from the XML, and then with `mapping`, it renames it to `capital`. Because XML has extra attributes we don't want to have in the response, like'- m`, we ban them from the response.

Test this endpoint with the two-letter code of a country:

<URLInputBox endpoint="http://localhost:8080/capital-of/" placeholder="FR" />

See the [SOAP documentation](https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/backends/soap/) for more details.

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>
}

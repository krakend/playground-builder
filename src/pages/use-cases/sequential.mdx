## Endpoint
```http
/sequential
```

## Chaining calls using the sequential proxy
Sometimes, you need to call a backend call with data from a previous call. This use case illustrates how an endpoint fetches data from a Hotel's endpoint, retrieves a `destination_id`, and passes it to the Destinations API to have the enriched query.

The sequential proxy only requires you to add the following configuration:

```
"proxy": {
  "sequential": true
}
```

Then, all backends are executed one after the other (instead of in parallel).

You can see the merged data from the Hotels and the resolved dependency under Destinations endpoints here:

[http://localhost:8080/sequential](http://localhost:8080/sequential)

See the [Sequential Proxy documentation](https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/endpoints/sequential-proxy/) for more details.

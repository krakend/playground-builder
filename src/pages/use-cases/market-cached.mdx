## Endpoint
```http
/market/cached
```

## Caching responses
This use case demonstrates how to cache responses from the backend in the gateway. Caching allows you to reduce the number of calls a user sends to the origin, reducing the network traffic and alleviating the pressure on your services.

When you call the `/market/cached` endpoint for the first time, the origin response is stored in memory, and subsequent calls are served from memory instead.

To enable caching, you only need to add the `"qos/http-cache": {}` namespace.

The TTL of the cache is taken from the response headers of the backend.

See the [Response Caching documentation](https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/backends/caching/) for more details.

Check the tracing dashboard to see the loading times with better precision than the `time` command.

First call uncached:
```
time curl http://localhost:8080/market/cached
```

Second call cached:
```
time curl http://localhost:8080/market/cached
```
